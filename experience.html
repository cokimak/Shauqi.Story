<p>Before getting into UiTM, I work as a part-timer in 3 different places.</p>
<p>My first job is at the Mydin Mall. I work as the retailer for a shoes shop but only for a few weeks because I am not suitable for the job.
Maybe I am just not friendly with the customer or too slow. The job I were told to do is pretty simple, ask the customer whatever shoes they need or
the size they want.</p>
<p>Then, I worked at a rice factory in my hometown but just for a while because my parents do not want me to, maybe because of the tiring job factor.
I stayed for not more than 5 days because of the argument from the family members.</p>
<p>Lastly, I worked at a street pizza stall called "HotPizza" and yet has been longest time I stayed for the job, which is around 3 months. 
This place is the one I remember having good time with, simply because few of my friends are also working with me.</p>
<p>After those working days, I took the remaining time before furthering my studies at UiTM with holidays and traveling with my friends.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Facebook</strong></li>
<p>The first social media I have ever known and used is Facebook, and I still use it to this
day. Ask anyone, what is their first social media platform they have used, chances are they will
come out Facebook. I mean, it is the most recognizable social media in the world. I started
using Facebook since 2008, few years after its released. I have a bad experience in using
Facebook where my old account has been hacked because I traded my Facebook account with
anonymous. Regardless, I am still using Facebook to this day and I enjoy using it.</p>
<li><strong>Instagram</strong></li>
<p>My other active social media platform is Instagram. Instagram is another social media
platform similar to Facebook, except it is the place where you post photos and short videos. I am currently using my smartphone to stream and use the social
media, so I am able to do much stuff on my account. I have been using Instagram since 2015. I see Instagram as a teen’s
favourite social media because it is simple, straight-forward, and also you cannot post photos
and videos through laptop or computer, which is the reason why teenagers and youth are among
top users who use Instagram.</p>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong></li>
<p>Lastly Twitter. Twitter is one of the social medias I am not too active on using it to
begin with. I created my account back in 2016, and gained only 35 followers
which mainly my friends and 137 following. I would not prefer using Twitter, to the point of
almost hating the platform. I want to emphasize on the
users, as there are a lot of users I met on Twitter, somewhat disgust me. There are these liberal
peoples who use Twitter to propagate their agenda of issues that Malaysia would not approve
such as LGBTQ+ and also the so-called dark side accounts which tweeting pornographic
contents. Even so, there are still people who use it on simple occasion such as tweeting about
facts, or simply tweeting their photos or their thoughts. Nonetheless, I don’t really enjoy using
Twitter that much.</p>
